# YelpCamp

The main objective of the YelpCamp project (which is a full-stack web application) is to teach students how to create a web application from scratch using technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more.

The fictional use case for the project is a platform where users can browse, add, and review campgrounds. This could be imagined as a service for an agency that organizes camping trips or simply a community-driven website that helps people find and share information about campgrounds.

When explaining the motive behind the project to an interviewer, you can mention that it was designed to demonstrate your ability to build full-stack web applications and showcase your proficiency in various web development technologies. Additionally, you can emphasize the practical use case of helping users discover campgrounds, book their trips, and share reviews of their experiences.

YelpCamp is the capstone project from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp 2023 course on Udemy.
